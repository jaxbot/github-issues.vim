Gissues.txt : Github-Issues.vim - Exactly what it sounds like ;)

INTRODUCTION			*Gissues*

Github issue lookup in Vim. Super simple. Comes with two main features:

Omnicomplete:

If you use Fugitive or edit gitcommit files in Vim, github-issues will automatically populate the omnicomplete menu with issues on Github. This is useful when you want to reference commits, close issues, etc., through Github's commit message parsing.

Neocomplete, etc., will automatically suggest commits.
If you use pure omnicomplete, use `C-x C-o` to pull up the menu.

No need to run commands, no need to configure. It just works. ;) (And if it doesn't, it should, so submit an issue) Not bad, huh?

Lookup menu:

To show Github issues for the current repository:

```
:Gissues
```

Press enter to view more details, or `i` to make a new issue.

On the details page, you can press `cc` to close the issue, or `co` to open it.

Pressing enter on a command will navigate to that commit.

INSTALLATION

Requires Vim with Python 2.7, Python 2.7 installed and working with Vim.

I recommend using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and Git cloning into ~/.vim/bundle. You can also just download the plugin and paste it into your plugin directory.

CONFIGURATION

Github-issues.vim should work out of the box for most cases. That's the goal, anyway. There are some options, however:

g:github_issues_no_omni

	When this is set to any value, github-issues will not set Neocomplete and Omnicomplete hooks.

g:github_access_token

	This is used if you work on private repositories. Grab an access token [from here](
	https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), then set this variable, preferably in your Vimrc, like so:

	`let g:github_access_token = "9jb19c1189f083d7013i24367lol"`

g:github_upstream_issues

	When this is set to 1, github-issues will use upstream issues (if repo is fork). This will require extra requests for the Github API, however.

g:github_issues_urls

	A dictionary of possible URLs that can be set as remotes. Defaults to ["github.com:", "https://github.com/"]

g:github_issues_max_pages

	How deep we search for issues; this will only request more issues if the issue count on a single page is equal to 30, which indicates that more may exist on a successive page. This is the maximum amount of pages to span; by design, these pages will not be queried if we don't hit a full page in a single request.

g:github_same_window

	Use the same window instead of splitting into a new one on :Gissues

g:github_api_url = "https://api.github.com/"

	If you use Github Enterprise, where the Github server is hosted somewhere other than Github.com, set this parameter to your API path. This is specifically for Github Enterprise and will not work for Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc.

THANKS

Special thanks goes to everyone who contributed their time and efforts to making this little plugin the awesomeness that it is today. Thank you!

SHAMELESS PLUG
